Purpose of the App 

 

The app provides users with dynamic food menu options based on the time of day (morning, afternoon, and dinner). By inputting the current time, users can view a curated menu specific to that time of day. The app offers a simple interface with two main features: a "Get Menu" button to display the menu for the selected time, and a "Reset" button to input a different time. 
 
Design Considerations: 

The app is designed to be simple and intuitive. It includes a time input field, a "Get Menu" button, and a "Reset" button. 

The app utilizes the time of day to dynamically display the appropriate menu, offering users a relevant selection based on morning, afternoon, or dinner hours. 
 
My code was designed based on the instructions I was given in this assignment and I included everything that was needed I also have a properly functioning app
